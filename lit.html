<h1>What type of thing is Literature</h1>
<p>
Literature can be described as all of the following:<br>
<b>Communication</b> <br>activity of conveying information. Communication requires a sender, a message, and an intended recipient,
 although the receiver need <br>not be present or aware of the sender's intent to communicate at the time of communication; thus communication
 can occur across vast distances in<br> time and space.<br>

<b>Written communication (writing) </b><br> representation of language in a textual medium through the use of a set of signs or symbols (known as a writing system)<br>
<b>One of the arts</b> <br>imaginative, creative, or nonscientific branch of knowledge, especially as studied academically.

<h2>History of literature</h2>
<p>The history of literature is the historical development of writings in prose or poetry that attempt to provide entertainment<br>, enlightenment, or instruction to the reader/listener/observer, 
as well as the development of the literary techniques used in the communication<br> of these pieces. Not all writings constitute literature.<br> Some recorded materials, such as compilations of data <br>(e.g., a check register) are not considered literature, 
and this article relates only to the evolution of the works defined above.</p>
